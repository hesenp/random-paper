    abstract = {<p>Probabilistic association discovery aims at
                  identifying the association between random vectors,
                  regardless of number of variables involved or
                  linear/nonlinear functional forms. Recently,
                  applications in high-dimensional data have generated
                  rising interest in probabilistic association
                  discovery. We developed a framework based on
                  functions on the observation graph, named MeDiA
                  (<underline>M</underline>ean
                  <underline>D</underline>istance
                  <underline>A</underline>ssociation). We generalize
                  its property to a group of functions on the
                  observation graph. The group of functions
                  encapsulates major existing methods in association
                  discovery, e.g. mutual information and Brownian
                  Covariance, and can be expanded to more complicated
                  forms. We conducted numerical comparison of the
                  statistical power of related methods under multiple
                  scenarios. We further demonstrated the application
                  of MeDiA as a method of gene set analysis that
                  captures a broader range of responses than
                  traditional gene set analysis methods.</p>},
