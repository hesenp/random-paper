abstract ={Identifying interesting relationships between pairs of
                  variables in large data sets is increasingly
                  important. Here, we present a measure of dependence
                  for two-variable relationships: the maximal
                  information coefficient (MIC). MIC captures a wide
                  range of associations both functional and not, and
                  for functional relationships provides a score that
                  roughly equals the coefficient of determination (R2)
                  of the data relative to the regression function. MIC
                  belongs to a larger class of maximal
                  information-based nonparametric exploration (MINE)
                  statistics for identifying and classifying
                  relationships. We apply MIC and MINE to data sets in
                  global health, gene expression, major-league
                  baseball, and the human gut microbiota and identify
                  known and novel relationships.},
