  Probablistic association discovery aims to identify the association
  between random vectors of their association, regardless of number of
  variables involved or linear/nonlinear functional forms. Application
  to high-dimensional data analysis has generated rising interest in
  probablistic association discovery.

  We developed a framework for probablistic association discovery on
  the Euclidean space using functions on the observation graph. We
  first discuss the property of mean observation distance and its
  novel application to association discovery. Then we generalize the
  advantageous property to a group of functions on the observation
  graph. The group of functions encapsulates major existing methods in
  association discovery, like mutual information and Mira score. We
  conducted numerical comparison that shows differentiated testing
  power under multiple scenarios.
