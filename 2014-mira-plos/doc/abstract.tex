  Probablistic association discovery aims to identify the association
  between random vectors, regardless of number of variables involved
  or linear/nonlinear functional forms. Application to
  high-dimensional data analysis has generated rising interest in
  probablistic association discovery.

  We developed a framework for probablistic association discovery on
  the Euclidean space using functions on the observation graph. We
  first discuss the property of mean observation distance and its
  novel application to association discovery. Then we generalize the
  advantageous property to a group of functions on the observation
  graph. The group of functions encapsulates major existing methods in
  association discovery, like mutual information and Mira score, and
  can be expanded to more complicated forms. We conducted numerical
  comparison that shows differentiated testing power of related
  methods under multiple scenarios.
